   A40 Build — Roadmap data
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   Pure DAG of build tasks with hard/soft dependencies. The
   shape is layout-agnostic: the current swim-lane view is one
   way to render it; an auto-DAG view (e.g. dagre) can consume
   the same `tasks` + `edges` later with no data migration.

   Conventions:
   - `id`        stable kebab-case key, prefixed `t-`
   - `epic`      must match an `Epic.id` from blogData.ts
   - `posts`     blog post slugs (post slug = filename minus
                 leading `\d+-` prefix). 0..N per task.
   - `order`     optional manual depth override (otherwise
                 depth is computed from the dependency graph).
